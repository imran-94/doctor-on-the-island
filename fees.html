            <p>What Happens When You Request Our House Call Service?
            
            When a house call request is made, a fee quote will be given. Our on call house call doctor will then call you directly
            to discuss your situation. If both patient and doctor mutually agree to proceed with the house call, an estimated
            arrival time will be given, and is usually within 1 hour. Your doctor will then arrive to evaluate and provide
            treatment. With our house calls, your doctor always provides as much time as you need to have your questions answered.
            Patients are always given the option to go to their preferred pharmacy, lab or x-ray facility. A superbill, fully
            itemized and coded for insurance reimbursement, will be given to the you. Payment is then made by credit card or cash.
            After any further questions are answered, the physician departs. But this is not where it ends. The physician will
            provide easy direct contact details for followup questions or problem troubleshooting. There is no charge for followup
            phone guidance given after the house call.
            
            
            
            Health Insurance: We require payment at the time of service. We do not accept insurance.
            
            Payment by cash or credit card. HSA and FSA cards accepted. No checks, sorry.</p>
